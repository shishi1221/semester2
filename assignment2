# Step 1: Load a built-in dataset and run regression
# For this example, let's use the built-in dataset 'mtcars' and run a linear regression
data(mtcars)
model <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)
summary(model)

# Step 2: Plot a scatterplot of Y & X
plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg, main = "Scatterplot of mpg vs wt", xlab = "Weight", ylab = "Miles per Gallon")

# Step 3: Extract residuals & coefficients
residuals <- resid(model)
coefficients <- coef(model)
print("Residuals:")
print(head(residuals))
print("Coefficients:")
print(coefficients)

# Step 4: Change the specification to add a polynomial
# Let's add a quadratic term (X^2) to the model
model_poly <- lm(mpg ~ wt + I(wt^2), data = mtcars)
summary(model_poly)

# Step 5: Add an interaction effect
# Let's add an interaction effect between 'wt' and 'hp'
model_interaction <- lm(mpg ~ wt * hp, data = mtcars)
summary(model_interaction)
